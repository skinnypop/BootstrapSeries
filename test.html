        Hi, this is my completely awesome Game of Thrones fan site built by an uber-talented web developer from CodeSLO. If you haven't seen GoT before you really need to. It's a fantasy series with a huge cast of characters that is known for being really brutal and unpredictable. It's got great acting and the best special effects on television. 

        Rumors that this show has completely consumed my life are false. 

        Keep reading for even more Game of Thrones awesomeness. All character and place names are copyright HBO and I'm probably breaking some kind of law by using them here but whatevs, it's free advertising for HBO so what are they complaining about?
